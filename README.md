# String-Theory-Class
A repository of string theory I course that I am struggling to learn in USTC as a master student
## Reasons for this repository
- No longer a popular field at least in current theoretic physics research due to the long-standing problem of lacking support from experiment;
- Seems difficult to learn for a beginner especially for those people (like me!) who are only willing to learn some keypoints and ideas to support their own interested majors;
- Extremely silly for some insitute which requires to pick up such a course
- The valuable materials are really on-demanding, maybe reflecting a lack of general interest?
## Some recommended Textbook and Lecture Notes
- String theory and M-Theory: A modern introduction 
- Lecture Notes in this repository (Believe me the novice-friendly lecture notes are really lacking!)

I will continue to upload mainly my homework solutions and more related materials to this repository, if anyone finds this repository useful, please share it; Or any other valuable resources, please tell me to add it up.
