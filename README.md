# String-Theory-Class
A repository of string theory I course that I am struggling to learn in USTC as a master student in 2020.
## Reasons for this repository:
- Extremely difficult to learn for a beginner especially for those people (like me!) who are only willing to learn some keypoints and ideas to support their own interested majors;
- A compulsory class for graduates in my department but hard to pass the final exam.
- Helpful and hands-on materials are really scarce as far as I know.
## Some recommended Textbook and Lecture Notes:
- String theory and M-Theory: A modern introduction (Our Lecturer recommends to use the textbook,but ommit a lot of explannation to give help to beginner)
- Lecture Notes in this repository (Believe me the novice-friendly lecture notes are really lacking!)

I will continue to upload more related materials to this repository, if anyone finds this repository useful, please share it; Or any other valuable resources, please tell me to add it up.
## Some Websites Highly recommended:
